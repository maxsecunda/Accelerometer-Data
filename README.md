# Accelerometer-Data

This project takes accelerometer data, recorded on a phone app and plots it into a three dimensional graph.

Raw_data is an example of the raw data that this code is designed to use. 

In the first steps, the code cleans the data, removes any unnecessary lines, it then takes the clensed data and plots it onto a three dimensional graph.
